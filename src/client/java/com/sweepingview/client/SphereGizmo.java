/**
 * A solid sphere gizmo, modelled on Lucidity's sculk sensor range visualiser (which uses Ryan's
 * Rendering Kit's {@code SphereShape}).
 *
 * <p>Vanilla's {@code Gizmos} helper only exposes cuboids, circles, lines, arrows, rects, points and
 * billboard text - there is no sphere. {@link Gizmo} itself is a public extension point though:
 * {@link GizmoPrimitives} hands out {@code addLine} / {@code addQuad} / {@code addTriangleFan}, so a
 * mod can emit any geometry it likes while still going through the whole gizmo pipeline (per-frame
 * collection, fading, the alpha multiplier, and the optional always-on-top depth bypass).
 *
 * <p>The surface is a latitude/longitude mesh, the same construction as
 * {@code SphereShape#generateSphereShape}.
 *
 * <h2>Why quads and not triangle fans</h2>
 *
 * <p>The obvious way to emit a sphere patch is {@code addTriangleFan}, and it is what this class used
 * to do. It is also a trap. {@code MultiBufferSource.BufferSource.getBuffer} flushes the previous
 * buffer whenever the render type cannot consolidate consecutive geometry:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * BufferBuilder builder = this.startedBuilders.get(renderType);
 * if (builder != null && !renderType.canConsolidateConsecutiveGeometry()) {
 *     this.endBatch(renderType, builder);   // a real draw call, every single time
 *     builder = null;
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>And {@code canConsolidateConsecutiveGeometry()} is just {@code !mode().connectedPrimitives}, so
 * every connected primitive mode - {@code TRIANGLE_FAN} included - is unmergeable. Vanilla's own
 * {@code DrawableGizmoPrimitives$Group} then makes it worse by calling {@code getBuffer} inside the
 * per-fan loop for fans, and outside the loop for quads. Net effect: one draw call per triangle fan,
 * versus one draw call for any number of quads. At 48 x 12 patches that is 576 draw calls per sphere,
 * per frame, per target - which is exactly the frame rate cliff this class used to cause. Adding
 * ImmediatelyFast fixes it because its {@code BatchableBufferSource} defers unmergeable render types
 * and draws them in one batch; relying on another mod for that is not reasonable, so this class now
 * goes through the mergeable quad path instead.
 *
 * <p>{@code debug_filled_box} back face culls, so each patch is submitted twice with opposite winding
 * to keep the sphere visible from the inside. Both copies land in the same consolidated vertex buffer,
 * so the second one costs vertices but not a draw call. That trade is worth it: doubling 1152
 * triangles is free next to 576 draw calls.
 *
 * <p>{@link #emit} runs every frame, so the mesh is a flat table of unit-sphere corner offsets built
 * once at class load rather than a few thousand {@code sin}/{@code cos} calls per frame.
